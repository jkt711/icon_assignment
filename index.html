        <p>Disposable facial masks tossed onto the beach, pose a danger to the coastal species of the Rockaway Peninsula, local conservation groups fear. </p>
        <p>"Right now, we're starting to see an increase in masks and gloves picked up on the beach," said Nicole Valenti, education and volunteer coordinator for the New York Marine Rescue Center. "That's an unfortunate side effect of the pandemic
          right now." </p>
        <p> Reports of animals maimed or killed by PPE's have begun to surface worldwide as the pandemic carries on. Shoreline birds, in particular, have been found entangled in the masks straps, and killed after ingesting PPE'S. </p>
        <p>Facial masks and plastic gloves are new contenders in the community's battle against littering; several conservation groups, including the Jamaica Bay Rockaways Park Conservancy and The American Littoral Society, regularly host clean-up
          initiatives with the help of volunteers.</p>
        <p>The lack of volunteer support is further compounded by de Blasio's announcement last month that thousands of NYC parks department workers may possibly be laid off in October. While data collection on marine debris is still being collected
          by the state for the Ocean Conservancy, conservation groups expect to be inundated with trash removal for the remainder of the season: </p>
        <p>"Everything is slowed down, but as I told the beach clean-up coordinator, I said, 'Don't worry about it. Just do what we can,'" said Don Repie, a member of the American Littoral Society who is often referred to as the Guardian of Jamaica
          Bay. "And hopefully, next year, by next September, we may be back to almost full staffing."

          <p>With the global pandemic still in full force, the numbers on PPE usage and disposal are mind-numbing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A recent study published in <i>The Journal of Environmental Science & Technology</i>, 129 billion face masks and 65 billion gloves have been used globally each month since the beginning of the pandemic. </li>
            <br>
            <li>According to The Waste Free Oceans organization, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/08/more-masks-than-jellyfish-coronavirus-waste-ends-up-in-ocean">Disposable facial masks take 450 years to decompose.</a>

          <p>Volunteer</p>
          <p><img src="Images_copy/volunteer.png"></p>
          <p>Volunteers play a crucial role in helping conservation groups maintain safe spaces for wildlife. Certain social distancing restrictions, however, have limited the number of volunteers. Since different organizations may be funded by state and/or federal programs, guidelines may differ:</p>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li> In 2019, the Jamaica Bay Rockaway Parks Conservancy had 1,300 volunteers. Executive Director, Alex Zablocki estimates that the volunteer count for 2020 will be half of that.</li>
